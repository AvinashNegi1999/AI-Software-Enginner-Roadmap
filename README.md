## 📖 About The Project

This repository contains **The Master Plan**, a self-contained web application designed to track your study progress through a rigorous 40-week roadmap. Unlike static markdown lists, this is a fully interactive dashboard.

It is tailored for students aiming for **Top-Tier Software & AI Engineering roles** (FAANG/MS in Germany) by 2026.

### ✨ Key Features

* **📊 Visual Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of your progress using **Chart.js**. Includes a "Skills Radar" to balance DSA, Development, and AI skills.
* **💾 Local Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to save your progress automatically. Close the browser, come back later, and your checkboxes remain checked.
* **⚡ Single-File Architecture:** No `npm install`, no React build steps, no backend. Just one `index.html` file powered by Tailwind CDN.
* **🗺️ Strategic Phases:** Broken down into 5 distinct phases (DSA, Core, Web/DevOps, AI, Capstone).
* **📱 Responsive:** Works beautifully on Desktop and Mobile.

* **Structure:** Semantic HTML5
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN)
* **Icons:** [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)
* **Data Visualization:** [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

## 🎨 Customization

Want to change the roadmap? It's easy.

1.  Open `index.html` in a code editor (VS Code).
2.  Search for `<div id="view-roadmap">`.
3.  Copy and paste an existing `task-item` block.
4.  **Crucial:** Ensure the new checkbox has a unique ID (e.g., `id="task-16"`).
5.  Update the `TASKS` object in the `<script>` tag at the bottom to include your new ID in the calculations.

```javascript
// Example: Adding a new task to Phase 1
const TASKS = {
    ids: [..., 'task-16'],
    weights: {
        'phase1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 16], // Added 16 here
        ...
    }
};
